# Deep-Leaning---MNIST-dataset

This one my first indepent project in deep learning. Here I utilized fully connected neural network to explore the MNIST dataset. Three callbacks were defined in the dataset.


I was able to achieve an accuracy of test dataset of 91%. My categorical cross-entropy loss is 0.33.
