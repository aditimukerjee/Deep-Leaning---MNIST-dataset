# Deep-Leaning---MNIST-dataset

This one my first indepent project in deep learning. Here I utilized fully connected neural network to explore the MNIST dataset. Three callbacks were defined in the dataset.

By applying fully connected neural network:
I was able to achieve an accuracy of test dataset of 91%. My categorical cross-entropy loss is 0.33. 

By applying convolutional neural network:
I was able to achieve an accuracy of test dataset of 99%. My categorical cross-entropy loss is 0.34.
